# V12: Test coverage

## Control Objective

Ensure that a verified contract satisfies the following high-level requirements:
* The specification has been formally tested,
* The implementation has been tested statically and dynamically,
* The implementation has been tested using symbolic execution.

Category “V12” lists requirements related to the testing process of the smart contracts.

## Security Verification Requirements

| # | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **12.1** | Verify that considered as sensitive functions of verified contract are covered with tests in the development phase. |
| **12.2** | Verify that the implementation of verified contract has been checked for security vulnerabilities using static and dynamic analysis. |
| **12.3** | Verify that the specification of smart contract has been formally verified.  | 
| **12.4** | Verify that the specification and the result of formal verification is included in the documentation.  |
