# G8: Denial of service

## Control Objective

Ensure that a verified contract satisfies the following high-level requirements:
* The contract logic prevents influencing the availability of the contract.

Category “G8” lists requirements related to the possible denial of service of the smart contracts.

## Security Verification Requirements

| # | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **G8.1** | Verify that there are no vulnerabilities associated with Denial of Service. | 
| **G8.2** | Verify that the contract does not iterate over unbound loops.  | 
| **G8.3** | Verify that self-destruct functionality is used only if necessary.  If it is included in the contract, it should be clearly described in the documentation. | 
| **G8.4** | Verify that the business logic does not block its flows when any of the participants are absent forever. | 
| **G8.5** | Verify that the contract logic does not disincentivize users to use contracts (e.g. the cost of the transaction is higher than the profit). | 
| **G8.6** | Verify that expressions of functions *assert* or *require* have a passing variant. | 
| **G8.7** | Verify that if *fallback* function is not callable by anyone, it is not blocking the functionalities of the contract |
| **G8.8** | Verify that there are no costly operations in a loop. | 
| **G8.9** | Verify that there are no calls to untrusted contracts in a loop. | 
| **G8.10** | Verify that if there is a possibility of suspending the operation of the contract, it is also possible to resume it. | 
| **G8.11** | Verify that if allow lists and deny lists are used, it does not interfere with the normal operation of the system. | 
| **G8.12** | Verify that there is no DoS caused by overflows and underflows. |
